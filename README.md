# Inter_3
This project implements Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression using a housing price dataset. The goal is to understand model building, evaluation, and visualization using Scikit-Learn.

For DataSet : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction


1. Import & preprocess dataset

  Load CSV using Pandas

  Remove missing values

  Convert categorical features to numeric (one-hot encoding)

2. Train–test split

  Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets

3. Train Linear Regression Models

  Multiple Linear Regression: Uses all features to predict price

  Simple Linear Regression: Uses one selected feature

  Plot simple regression line

4. Model Evaluation

  Metrics used:

  MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

  MSE (Mean Squared Error)

  RMSE

  R² Score

5. Coefficient Interpretation

  Shows feature coefficients

  Identifies how each feature affects housing price
